## Intuition

The first I did was to check how much steps would been possible with higher numbers to see if there was any countable pattern in this formula just by pen and paper. I used 5 and 6 and I notice that the result was equal to the **Fibonaci sequence**, so 5 was equal to 8 and 6 to 13.
This is because

$f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$

 and this is the definition of Fibonacci formula.
Whay may be hard to see by the description of the problem itslef but just by checking in paper what results may have other numbers you can notice this if you know what Fibonacci sequence is.

## Approach

This was easy to code because was one of the first things I coded when starting to learn programming.

So,

1. First, handle the base cases: `if n â‰¤ 2`, then the number of ways equals `n`.
2. For larger values of `n`, use an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci numbers:

    - Initialize two variables to represent the number of ways to reach step 1 (`step1 = 1`) and step 2 (`step2 = 2`).
    - Iterate from 3 to `n`, calculating each subsequent value using the Fibonacci formula.
    - At each step, update `step1` and `step2` to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:
**O(n)** We only need a single loop from 3 to n to calculate the answer. Each iteration involves a constant number of operations. In the best case would be O(1) if `n â‰¤ 2`

- **Space complexity**:
**O(1)** We only need three variables (`step1`, `step2`, and `temp`) regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is constant.
