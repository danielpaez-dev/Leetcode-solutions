## Intuition

The problem is asking us to find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between two vertical lines on a graph. My first thought is that the area of water contained between any two lines is determined by:

- The width between the lines (distance between indices)
- The height of the shorter line (water can only rise as high as the shorter line)

This suggests a direct formula: area = width Ã— minimum height. Just like the **area of a rectangle**.

## Approach

Instead of checking every possible pair (which would be O(nÂ²)), we can use a two-pointer approach so we can minimize the calculus by getting the max area of the higher points from left to right. This is done just like this:

1. Start with pointers at the extreme ends of the array (maximum width)
2. Calculate the area based on the current pointers
3. Move the pointer with the shorter height inward (since moving the taller one would only decrease the area)
4. Continue until the pointers meet

This approach works because:

- Starting with maximum width gives us a potential maximum area
- Moving inward decreases width, so we need to find taller lines to compensate
- Moving the shorter line inward is optimal because:

    - The current shorter line is limiting our current area
    - Keeping it would only lead to smaller areas as width decreases
    - Moving it gives us a chance to find a taller line that might increase area

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**

    - We process each element at most once, making a single pass through the array
    - Each iteration requires constant time operations
    - Maximum iterations = length of the array - 1

- **Space complexity: O(1)**

    - We only use a fixed number of variables regardless of input size
    - No additional data structures are needed

    let maxArea = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        let area = (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

        height[left] < height[right] ? left++ : right--;
    }

    return maxArea;
};
```

### Python

- **[Map Solution GitHub](../solutions/Python/11.ContainerWithMostWater.py)**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area: int = 0
        left: int = 0
        right: int = len(height) - 1

        while left < right:
            area: int = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
            max_area = max(max_area, area)

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return max_area
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
    let maxArea: number = 0;
    let left: number = 0;
    let right: number = height.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        let area: number = (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

        height[left] < height[right] ? left++ : right--;
    }

    return maxArea;
};
```
