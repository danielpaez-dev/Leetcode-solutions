## Intuition

The problem requires identifying authors who have viewed their own articles. This involves finding records where the author_id matches the viewer_id in the Views table, then presenting these unique author IDs in ascending order.

## Approach

1. **SELECT** the **author_id** **FROM** the **Views** table
2. Use **DISTINCT** to eliminate duplicate author IDs
3. Apply a filter condition **WHERE author_id = viewer_id** (authors viewing their own content)
4. Order the results in **asc**ending order by author_id

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n log n)**
The solution requires scanning through all n records in the Views table once, with additional time for sorting operations (typically O(n log n) in database systems).

- **Space complexity: O(k)**
Where k is the number of distinct authors who viewed their own content. The result set only stores unique author IDs that meet the criteria.
