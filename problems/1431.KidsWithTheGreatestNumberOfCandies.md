## Intuition

The problem is about determining which kids will have the greatest number of candies after receiving extra candies. We need to check if each kid's current candies plus the extra candies would be greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies any kid has initially.

## Approach

Find the maximum number of candies any kid has initially
For each kid, check if their current number of candies plus the extra candies would make them have at least as many candies as the kid with the most candies
Return a boolean array where each position indicates whether the corresponding kid will have the greatest number of candies

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**
Where n is the number of kids (length of the candies array)
  - We iterate through the array twice:
    - Once to find the maximum (O(n))
    - Once to determine if each kid will have enough candies (O(n))

- **Space complexity: O(n)**
For the boolean result array

### JavaScript

- **[Solution GitHub](../solutions/JavaScript/1431.KidsWithTheGreatestNumberOfCandies.js)**

```javascript
var kidsWithCandies = function(candies, extraCandies) {
    const MAX_CANDIES = Math.max(...candies);
    let enoughCandies = [];
    for(candy of candies){
        enoughCandies.push(candy + extraCandies >= MAX_CANDIES);
    }
    return enoughCandies;
};
```

### Python

- **[Solution GitHub](../solutions/Python/1431.KidsWithTheGreatestNumberOfCandies.py)**

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        enoughCandies = []
        MAX_CANDIES = max(candies)
        for candy in candies:
            if candy + extraCandies >= MAX_CANDIES:
                enoughCandies.append(True)
            else:
                enoughCandies.append(False)
        return enoughCandies
```

### TypeScript

- **[Solution GitHub](../solutions/TypeScript/1431.KidsWithTheGreatestNumberOfCandies.ts)**

```typescript
function kidsWithCandies(candies: number[], extraCandies: number): boolean[] {
    const MAX_CANDIES: number = Math.max(...candies);
    let enoughCandies: boolean[] = [];
    for(let candy of candies){
        enoughCandies.push(candy + extraCandies >= MAX_CANDIES);
    }
    return enoughCandies;
};
