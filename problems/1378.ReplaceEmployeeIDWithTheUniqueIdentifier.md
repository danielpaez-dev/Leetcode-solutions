## Intuition

This problem requires joining two tables to replace employee IDs with their unique identifiers. We need to retrieve all employees from the Employees table along with their unique identifiers from the EmployeeUNI table, even if some employees don't have a unique identifier.

## Approach

The key insight is that we need to preserve all records from the Employees table while adding the unique identifiers where available. This is a perfect use case for a **LEFT JOIN** operation, which returns all records from the left table (Employees) and the matched records from the right table (EmployeeUNI).
The LEFT JOIN ensures that all employees are included in the results, even those without a corresponding entry in the EmployeeUNI table. For employees without a unique identifier, the unique_id column will be NULL in the result set.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**
Where n is the number of records in the Employees table. The database engine needs to scan through all employees and find matching records in the EmployeeUNI table.

- **Space complexity: O(n)**
Where n is the number of records in the Employees table. The result set will contain one row for each employee.
