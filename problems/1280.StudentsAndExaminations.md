## Intuition

The problem requires displaying a report of students with their attendance in each subject. We need to show all student-subject combinations, even if the student hasn't attended any exams in a particular subject, and count how many exams each student attended per subject.

## Approach

1. Create a Cartesian product (**CROSS JOIN**) between Students and Subjects tables to get all possible student-subject combinations
2. Use **LEFT JOIN** with Examinations to count attendance for each combination
3. Group by student_id, student_name, and subject_name to count exam attendance per student per subject
4. Order the results by student_id and subject_name as required

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(s Ã— u Ã— e)**
    - Where s is the number of students, u is the number of subjects, and e is the number of examination records

- **Space complexity: O(s Ã— u)**
    - For storing all possible student-subject combinations in the result set

```mysql []
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, su.subject_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM Students AS s
CROSS JOIN Subjects AS su
LEFT JOIN Examinations AS e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND su.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, su.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, su.subject_name
