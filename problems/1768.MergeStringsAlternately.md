## Intuition

When merging two strings alternately, we need to interleave characters from both strings. The challenge is handling the case when one string is longer than the other. My first thought was to iterate through both strings simultaneously and append characters from each string in an alternating fashion, continuing with the remaining characters from the longer string once the shorter string is exhausted.

## Approach

1. Initialize an empty result string and a counter variable i starting at 0
2. Determine the length of each input string
3. Use a single loop that continues until we've processed all characters from both strings (until we reach the end of the longer string)
4. For each iteration:

    - If `i` is within bounds of `word1`, append the character at position `i` from `word1`
    - If `i` is within bounds of `word2`, append the character at position `i` from `word2`
    - Increment `i`

5. Return the resulting merged string

This approach handles uneven string lengths elegantly by checking if the current index is valid for each string before appending its character.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n):**
Where n is the length of the longer string. We iterate once through both strings in a single pass.

- **Space complexity: O(n):**
Where n is the combined length of both strings. The result string will contain all characters from both input strings.
