## Intuition

The problem asks us to find products that are both low in fat and recyclable. This is a simple filtering operation where we need to check two conditions simultaneously using operator AND.

## Approach

1. Use a **SELECT** statement to retrieve product IDs **from** the Products table
2. Apply a **WHERE** clause to filter products that meet both criteria:

    - They must be low in fat (low_fats = 'Y')
    - They must be recyclable (recyclable = 'Y')

3. The **AND** operator ensures both conditions must be true for a product to be included in the results

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**
Where n is the number of rows in the Products table. The query needs to scan each row once to check the conditions.

- **Space complexity: O(m)**
Where n is the number of products that satisfy both conditions. The result set size depends on how many products meet the criteria.
