## Intuition

We have to group data by `class` and counting students within each group.

## Approach

The solution requires:

1. Grouping records by the class field
2. Counting how many students are in each class
3. Filtering to only include classes with 5 or more students

I used the **GROUP BY** clause to organize records by class, and the **HAVING** clause to filter groups after aggregation. The **COUNT** function allows us to determine the number of students in each class.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**
    - The database needs to scan through all n records once to perform the grouping and counting.
- **Space complexity: O(k)**
    - Where k is the number of unique classes. The database needs to maintain group information for each unique class during aggregation.
