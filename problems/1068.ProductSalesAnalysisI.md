## Intuition

This problem requires joining information from two database tables to retrieve specific product details along with their sales information.

## Approach

The solution uses a simple **JOIN** operation between the Product and Sales tables. By connecting these tables through their common product_id field, we can extract the required data points: product name, year, and price.
The **USING** clause is employed as a cleaner alternative to the traditional ON clause when joining on columns with identical names in both tables.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**
Where n represents the number of records in the Sales table that need to be processed.

- **Space complexity: O(m)**
The m represents the size of the resulting output set.
