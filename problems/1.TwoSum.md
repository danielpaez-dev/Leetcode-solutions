## Intuition

My initial approach was brute force, which has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) because it involves comparing each number with every other number in the array. It was the easies solution but proved inefficient as the metrics of other people showed, so I aimed for a solution with at least a time complexity of O(n).

## Approach

The approach iterates through the nums array only once. For each number nums[i], the algorithm calculates its complement (the value needed to reach the target: target - nums[i]). It then checks if this complement already exists as a key in the numMap object (which acts as a hash table). If the complement is found, the algorithm returns an array containing the index of the complement (stored in numMap) and the current index i. If the complement is not found, the current number nums[i] and its index i are added to the numMap for future lookups. This avoids nested loops, achieving linear time complexity.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n)
The algorithm iterates through the nums array only once. The operations within the loop (calculating the complement, checking numMap, and adding to numMap) take constant time on average. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

- **Space complexity**: O(n)
In the worst-case scenario (where no two numbers sum to the target until the end of the array or if no solution exists), the numMap object could store all n elements of the nums array. Hence, the space complexity is O(n). While this uses more space than the brute-force
