## Intuition

The problem appears to require finding employees who either have a bonus less than 1000 or have no bonus recorded at all. My first thought is to use a **LEFT JOIN** to include all employees regardless of whether they have a bonus entry, then filter the results with a WHERE clause.

## Approach

1. Use a LEFT JOIN between the Employee and Bonus tables to ensure all employees are included in the result set, even those without bonus records
2. Join the tables on the common empId field using the USING syntax
3. Apply a WHERE clause to filter for employees with either:

    - A bonus less than 1000
    - No bonus record (NULL value)

4. Select only the name from Employee table and the bonus from Bonus table for the final result

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n)**
    - Where n is the number of employees
    - The query performs a single LEFT JOIN operation which typically has linear complexity
    -The filtering conditions are applied once for each row in the joined result

- **Space complexity: O(n)**
    - Where n is the number of employees
    - The result set will include all employees who either have a bonus less than 1000 or no bonus record
    - In the worst case, this could be all employees in the database
