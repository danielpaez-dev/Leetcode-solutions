## Intuition

The objective of the problem is to obtain the data of the first and last name of the **Person** and the `city` and `state` of the person from the **Address** showing only the data of those persons that exist.

## Approach

To do this we must use a **LEFT JOIN** since this returns the rows of the left table and only the matches of the right table and in case of not existing it will appear as `NULL`.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**:
I don't know how time complexity work in SQL

- **Space complexity**:
**O(1)** as there is no additional storage.
