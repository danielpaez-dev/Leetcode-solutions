## Intuition

For this problem, I needed to understand what makes a string a divisor of another string. A string X is considered a divisor of string Y if Y can be formed by repeating X a certain number of times. For two strings to have a common divisor, they must both be constructible by repeating the same base string.
The critical insight is that if a common divisor exists between two strings, concatenating them in either order should yield identical results. This is because both strings are fundamentally composed of the same repeating pattern.

## Approach

My approach follows these logical steps:

1. First, I verify whether a common divisor exists by checking if str1 + str2 equals str2 + str1. If these concatenations aren't equal, no common divisor exists, and I return an empty string.

2. If a common divisor exists, I determine its maximum possible length by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of both input strings.

3. We'll code the Euclidean algorithm in JavaScript and TypeScript since the Math.GCD doesn't exist as it does in Python. It is used to efficiently compute this GCD. This algorithm works by repeatedly applying the principle that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b) until b becomes zero, at which point a is the GCD.

4. Finally, I extract the substring from the beginning of either input string, with the length equal to the calculated GCD.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity: O(n+m)**
    The overall time complexity is dominated by the string operations, resulting in O(m + n).

- **Space complexity: O(n+m)**
    The space required for the concatenated strings (str1 + str2 and str2 + str1) is O(m + n). The final result requires at most min(m, n) space. Therefore, the total space complexity is O(m + n).
