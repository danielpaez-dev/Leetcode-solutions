## Intuition

The problem asks us to find a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers in any order.

## Approach

We perform a self-join on the `Employee` table to connect each employee with their corresponding manager. We use two aliases: `e` for employees and `m` for managers. The join condition `e.managerId = m.id` ensures we're matching each employee with their direct manager. Then, we filter the results to only include rows where the employee's salary exceeds their manager's salary using the condition `e.salary > m.salary`.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: $$O(n \times m)$$
Where `n` is the number of employees and `m` is the number of managers. In the worst case, this is $$O(n^2)$$ since every employee could potentially be matched against every manager during the join operation.

- **Space complexity**: $$O(k)$$
Where `k` is the number of employees who earn more than their managers (the result set size).
